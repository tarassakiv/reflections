First task
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	You may also want to commit and push your changes. When you're finished, click "Next" and Sarah will go over what to do if you want to share your changes to a repository and you don't have permission to modify the original.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
